# 🏯 RealEstateV1 — Autonomous Real Estate Platform (MVP)

Welcome to **RealEstateV1**, an experimental playground for building an **autonomous multi-agent system** designed for real estate transactions.  

The vision: users (buyers, sellers, renters) only register → the AI agents handle **everything else** end-to-end until a deal is closed.  

---

## ⚡ Current Status (MVP Playground)
- ✅ Local development setup  
- ✅ GitHub repo synced  
- ✅ Hugging Face demo deployment (in progress)  
- ✅ Agents stubbed & connected (basic responses)  
- 🚧 Next: full autonomy + real workflows

## ⚔️ The 9-Agent Battle Plan (三国 角色)

Inspired by *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* (三国演义), our agents are modeled after legendary figures:  

### 🏯 Wei (魏) — Market Intelligence (曹操 Cao Cao’s Domain)
- **Agent 1 — 曹操 (Cao Cao, The Warlord Strategist)** → Market analysis & macro trends  
- **Agent 2 — 许褚 (Xu Chu, The Fierce Protector)** → Competitor & market intelligence gathering  
- **Agent 3 — 郭嘉 (Guo Jia, The Oracle Advisor)** → Predictive modeling for pricing & timing  

### 🏯 Shu (蜀) — Client Engagement (刘备 Liu Bei’s Brotherhood)
- **Agent 4 — 刘备 (Liu Bei, The Benevolent Leader)** → Buyer & seller onboarding, trust building  
- **Agent 5 — 关羽 (Guan Yu, The Negotiator)** → Automated deal-making, fairness in negotiation  
- **Agent 6 — 张飞 (Zhang Fei, The Guardian)** → Customer support, ensuring loyalty & care  

### 🏯 Wu (吴) — Operations & Closure (孙权 Sun Quan’s Stronghold)
- **Agent 7 — 孙权 (Sun Quan, The Young Commander)** → Workflow & operations coordination  
- **Agent 8 — 周瑜 (Zhou Yu, The Contract Master)** → Legal documents & contract drafting  
- **Agent 9 — 诸葛亮 (Zhuge Liang, The Prime Minister)** → Final deal execution, strategy & follow-up  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python** (agents, orchestration)  
- **Gradio** (UI playground)  
- **LangGraph & Autogen** (LLM orchestration experiments)  
- **ZhipuAI GLM** (primary LLM backbone, swappable later with OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)  
- **GitHub + Hugging Face** (versioning + demo deployment)  

---

## 📌 Roadmap
1. 🎮 Sandbox MVP (stubbed agents + UI, done ✅)  
2. 🌐 Hugging Face deployment (in progress)  
3. 🧠 Connect all agents with real LLM calls  
4. 📊 Add persistent storage (e.g., PostgreSQL + cloud storage)  
5. ⚡ Upgrade agents into autonomous actors (decision-making, predictive modeling)  
6. 🏗️ Scale to full **Autonomous Real Estate Platform**
