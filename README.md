# 🏡 RealEstateV1 – Autonomous Real Estate Platform

## 🚀 Vision
RealEstateV1 is an **autonomous AI-driven real estate platform** where buyers, sellers, and renters simply register — and AI agents handle the rest.  
Our goal is to **redefine real estate transactions** by automating tedious processes such as property listings, buyer–seller matching, negotiations, and predictive insights.

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- 🤖 **AI Agents** for buyers, sellers, and renters.
- 🔎 Property search and recommendation.
- 📊 Predictive analytics for pricing and demand.
- 📑 Document preparation & deal closing automation.
- 🔐 Secure, privacy-first design.
- ☁️ Cloud-ready for scaling to production.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Gradio** – interactive UI for prototyping
- **ZhipuAI GLM** (with option to plug into multiple LLMs)
- **FastAPI / Uvicorn** (planned backend services)
- **Cloud deployment**: initially free-tier, scalable for growth

✅ This README will instantly make your repo look **clear, ambitious, and professional** on GitHub.  

👉 Do you want me to also generate a `.gitignore` file (for PyCharm, Python, and venv) so you don’t push unnecessary stuff?
