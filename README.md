# 🏡 RealEstateV1 — 三國計劃 (Battle Plan)

An experimental **multi-agent autonomous system** for the real estate domain.  
This is the **MVP playground** — syncing between **Local + GitHub + Hugging Face** deployment.  
Later, this evolves into a full **autonomous real estate platform**.

## ⚔️ The Nine Agents — Our 三国 Battle Plan
Inspired by 《三國演義》 *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.

Each “general” (agent) takes charge of a battlefield (domain task).  
Names are in **English** with **Chinese title (括号内)**.

### 🏯 Section I — Market Intelligence (蜀 Shu)
1. **Scout Agent (探子)** — scans new property listings, market signals.  
2. **Strategist Agent (軍師)** — analyzes trends, predicts values.  
3. **Messenger Agent (使者)** — communicates insights to other agents.

### 🛡️ Section II — Customer Operations (魏 Wei)
4. **Matchmaker Agent (紅娘)** — pairs buyers, sellers, renters.  
5. **Negotiator Agent (說客)** — handles price discussions, conditions.  
6. **Closer Agent (將軍)** — finalizes deals, ensures agreements.

### ⚡ Section III — Backend Autonomy (吳 Wu)
7. **Knowledge Agent (智者)** — keeps memory of users, properties.  
8. **Compliance Agent (律師)** — checks legal & financial rules.  
9. **Predictor Agent (先知)** — forecasts demand, risks, ROI.
